## About the language

> Swift was specifically developed for the Apple ecosystem and supports iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, Linux and z/OS. Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language. Since it is multi-paradigm it means it supports many different many different programming paradigms. In the case of Swift it supports functional programming paradigms as well as object oriented paradigms and generic programming paradigms. This lends to Swifts incredible versatility.
>
> - **History:** Swift's development did not begin until 2010. Chris Lattener was the lead developer on the project at the time and it wasn't until the project grew that other apple engeneers were brought on board. Chris has stated in the past that he took inspiration "from Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, CLU, and far too many others to list" when developing the programming features of swift. It wasnt until 2014 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference that people were exposed to swifts capabilties and the first beta of Swift was released. The first official release of swift wasn't until later that year in September of 2014.
> - **Features:** Swift has several unique features which seperate it from other languages:
>     - **Scoping / Accesibility**: In swift there are 5 different types you can apply to symbols to control access open, public, internal, fileprivate, and private. However unlike most langauges access controls ignore inheritance. Fileprivate is a little unique and allows the symbol to only be accesed within the file.
>     - **Simple Syntax:** Many basic types have been added to the languages core. For instance strings are invisibly connected to the NSString library and can be concatenated simply using the + operator
>     - **Protocals:** as with clojure swift has support for some protocal oriented programming. Protocals allow for the extension of classes without ever having to have access to the original class. Protocols can be created in isolation and then be extended later for specific classes, this use of generic programming lends itself well to swift's flexability. 

## About the syntax

> _give some code snippet of the language_

*Let form*

```clojure
(let [x 10
      y 20]
  (+ x y))
```

## About the tools

> _Describe the compiler or interpreter needed_.

## About the standard library

> _Give some examples of the functions and data structures
> offered by the standard library_.

## About open source library

> _Describe at least one contribution by the open source
community written in the language._

# Analysis of the language

> 1. The style of programming supported by the language: functional vs procedural programming
> 2. The ability to perform meta-programming such as macros
> 3. Symbol resolution and its support for closure
> 4. Scoping rules supported by the language: lexical vs dynamic scoping
> 5. Functional programming constructs either as part of the language or supported by the standard library of the runtime.
> 6. Its type system: static vs dynamic types
> 7. Strengths and weaknesses of the language
